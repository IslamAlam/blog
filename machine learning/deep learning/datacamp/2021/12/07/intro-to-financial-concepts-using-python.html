<strong>Growth and Rate of Return</strong></p>

<p><strong>Growth</strong>
 and
 <strong>Rate of Return</strong>
 are two concepts that are ubiquitous throughout the financial world.</p>

<p>Calculate the future value (cumulative return) of a $100 investment which grows at a rate of 6% per year for 30 years in a row and assign it to
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">future_value</code>
 .</p>

<p>####
<strong>Compound Interest</strong></p>

<p>As you saw in the previous exercise, both time and the rate of return are very important variables when forecasting the future value of an investment.</p>

<p>Another important variable is the number of compounding periods, which can greatly affect compounded returns over time.</p>

<strong>Discount Factors and Depreciation</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, not everything grows in value over time.</p>

<p>In fact, many assets
 <strong>depreciate</strong>
 , or lose value over time. To simulate this, you can simply assume a negative expected rate of return.</p>

<p>Calculate the future value of a $100 investment that depreciates in value by 5% per year for 10 years and assign it to
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">future_value</code>

<h2 id="12-present-and-future-value"><strong>1.2 Present and Future Value</strong></h2>

<p>####
<strong>Present Value</strong></p>

<p>Luckily for you, there is a module called
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code>
 which contains many functions which will make your life much easier when working with financial values.</p>

<p>The
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pv(rate, nper, pmt, fv)</code>
 function, for example, allows you to calculate the present value of an investment as before with a few simple parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>rate:</strong>
 The rate of return of the investment</li>
  <li><strong>nper:</strong>
 The lifespan of the investment</li>
  <li><strong>pmt:</strong>
 The (fixed) payment at the beginning or end of each period (which is 0 in our example)</li>
  <li><strong>fv:</strong>
 The future value of the investment</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use this formula in many ways. For example, you can calculate the present value of future investments in today’s dollars.</p>

<p>Compute the present value of an investment which will yield $10,000 15 years from now at an inflation rate of 3% per year and assign it to
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">investment_1</code>
 .</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>

</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how a higher inflation rate leads to a lower present value.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Future Value</strong></p>

<p>The
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code>
 module also contains a similar function,
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.fv(rate, nper, pmt, pv)</code>
 , which allows you to calculate the future value of an investment as before with a few simple parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>rate:</strong>
 The rate of return of the investment</li>
  <li><strong>nper:</strong>
 The lifespan of the investment</li>
  <li><strong>pmt:</strong>
 The (fixed) payment at the beginning or end of each period (which is 0 in our example)</li>
  <li><strong>pv:</strong>
 The present value of the investment</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that in this function call, you must pass a
 <strong>negative</strong>
 value into the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pv</code>
 parameter if it represents a
 <strong>negative cash flow</strong>
 (cash going out). In other words, if you were to compute the future value of an investment, requiring an up-front cash payment, you would need to pass a negative value to the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pv</code>
 parameter in the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.fv()</code>
 function.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate investment_1
investment_1 = np.fv(rate=0.05, nper=15, pmt=0, pv=-10000)
print("Investment 1 will yield a total of $" + str(round(investment_1, 2)) + " in 15 years")

# Calculate investment_2
investment_2 = np.fv(rate=0.08, nper=15, pmt=0, pv=-10000)
print("Investment 2 will yield a total of $" + str(round(investment_2, 2)) + " in 15 years")

# Investment 1 will yield a total of $20789.28 in 15 years
# Investment 2 will yield a total of $31721.69 in 15 years

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note how the growth rate dramatically affects the future value.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Adjusting Future Values for Inflation</strong></p>

<p>You can now put together what you learned in the previous exercises by following a simple methodology:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, forecast the future value of an investment given a rate of return</li>
  <li>Second, discount the future value of the investment by a projected inflation rate</li>
</ul>

<p>The methodology above will use both the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.fv()</code>
 and
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pv()</code>
 functions to arrive at the projected value of a given investment in today’s dollars, adjusted for inflation.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate investment_1
investment_1 = np.fv(rate=0.08, nper=10, pmt=0, pv=-10000)
print("Investment 1 will yield a total of $" + str(round(investment_1, 2)) + " in 10 years")

# Calculate investment_2
investment_1_discounted = np.pv(rate=0.03, nper=10, pmt=0, fv=investment_1)
print("After adjusting for inflation, investment 1 is worth $" + str(round(-investment_1_discounted, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Investment 1 will yield a total of $21589.25 in 10 years
# After adjusting for inflation, investment 1 is worth $16064.43 in today's dollars

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You now know how to project the value of investments and adjust for inflation.</p>

<h2 id="13-net-present-value-and-cash-flows"><strong>1.3 Net Present Value and Cash Flows</strong></h2>

<p>####
<strong>Discounting Cash Flows</strong></p>

<p>You can use numpy’s net present value function
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy.npv(rate, values)</code>
 to calculate the net present value of a series of cash flows.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Predefined array of cash flows
cash_flows = np.array([100, 100, 100, 100, 100])

# Calculate investment_1
investment_1 = np.npv(rate=0.03, values=cash_flows)
print("Investment 1's net present value is $" + str(round(investment_1, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Calculate investment_2
investment_2 = np.npv(rate=0.05, values=cash_flows)
print("Investment 2's net present value is $" + str(round(investment_2, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Calculate investment_3
investment_3 = np.npv(rate=0.07, values=cash_flows)
print("Investment 3's net present value is $" + str(round(investment_3, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Investment 1's net present value is $471.71 in today's dollars
# Investment 2's net present value is $454.6 in today's dollars
# Investment 3's net present value is $438.72 in today's dollars

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice how the higher discount rate leads to a lower NPV.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Initial Project Costs</strong></p>

<p>The
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy.npv(rate, values)</code>
 function is very powerful because it allows you to pass in both positive and negative values.</p>

<p>For this exercise, you will calculate the net present value of two potential projects with different cash flows:</p>

<p>|
 Year
  |
 Project 1
  |
 Project 2
  |
| — | — | — |
|
 1
  |
 -$250 (initial investment)
  |
 -$250 (initial investment)
  |
|
 2
  |
 $100 cash flow
  |
 $300 cash flow
  |
|
 3
  |
 $200 cash flow
  |
 -$250 (net investment)
  |
|
 4
  |
 $300 cash flow
  |
 $300 cash flow
  |
|
 5
  |
 $400 cash flow
  |
 $300 cash flow
  |</p>

<p>In this example, project 1 only requires an initial investment of $250, generating a slowly increasing series of cash flows over the next 4 years.</p>

<p>Project 2, on the other hand, requires an initial investment of $250 and an additional investment of $250 in year 3. However, project 2 continues to generate larger cash flows.</p>

<p>Assuming both projects don’t generate any more cash flows after the fifth year, which project would you decide to undertake? The best way to decide is by comparing the NPV of both projects.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Create an array of cash flows for project 1
cash_flows_1 = np.array([-250, 100, 200, 300, 400])

# Create an array of cash flows for project 2
cash_flows_2 = np.array([-250, 300, -250, 300, 300])

# Calculate the net present value of project 1
investment_1 = np.npv(rate=0.03, values=cash_flows_1)
print("The net present value of Investment 1 is worth $" + str(round(investment_1, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Calculate the net present value of project 2
investment_2 = np.npv(rate=0.03, values=cash_flows_2)
print("The net present value of Investment 2 is worth $" + str(round(investment_2, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# The net present value of Investment 1 is worth $665.54 in today's dollars
# The net present value of Investment 2 is worth $346.7 in today's dollars

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>####
<strong>Diminishing Cash Flows</strong></p>

<p>Remember how compounded returns grow rapidly over time? Well, it works in the reverse, too. Compounded discount factors over time will quickly shrink a number towards zero.</p>

<p>For example, $100 at a 3% annual discount for 1 year is still worth roughly $97.08:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/datacamp/intro-to-financial-concepts-using-python/capture3-14.png?w=808" alt="Desktop View" /></p>

<p>This means that the longer in the future your cash flows will be received (or paid), the close to 0 that number will be.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate investment_1
investment_1 = np.pv(rate=0.03, nper=30, pmt=0, fv=100)
print("Investment 1 is worth $" + str(round(-investment_1, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Calculate investment_2
investment_2 = np.pv(rate=0.03, nper=50, pmt=0, fv=100)
print("Investment 2 is worth $" + str(round(-investment_2, 2)) + " in today's dollars")

# Calculate investment_3
investment_3 = np.pv(rate=0.03, nper=100, pmt=0, fv=100)
print("Investment 3 is worth $" + str(round(-investment_3, 2)) + " in today's dollars")


# Investment 1 is worth $41.2 in today's dollars
# Investment 2 is worth $22.81 in today's dollars
# Investment 3 is worth $5.2 in today's dollars

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The moral of the story? It’s generally better to have money now rather than later.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Project Proposals and Cash Flows Projections</strong></p>

<p>Your project managers have projected the cash flows for each of the proposals.</p>

<p>Project 1 provides higher short term cash flows, but Project 2 becomes more profitable over time.</p>

<p>The cash flow projections for both projects are as follows:</p>

<p>|

  |
 -$1,000 (initial investment)

 $550
  |
 $600
  |

  |
 $625
  |</p>

<p>Note: The projections are provided in thousands. For example, $1,000 = $1,000,000. We will use the smaller denominations to make everything easier to read. This is also commonly done in financial statements with thousands or even millions in order to represent millions or billions.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Create a numpy array of cash flows for Project 1

# Create a numpy array of cash flows for Project 2
cf_project_2 = np.array([-1000, 150, 225, 300, 375, 425, 500, 575, 600, 625])

<strong>Internal Rate of Return</strong></p>

<p>Now that you have the cash flow projections ready to go for each project, you want to compare the
 <strong>internal rate of return</strong>
 (IRR) of each project to help you decide which project would be most beneficial for your company in terms of yield (rate of return).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate the internal rate of return for Project 1
irr_project1 = np.irr(cf_project1)
print("Project 1 IRR: " + str(round(100*irr_project1, 2)) + "%")

# Calculate the internal rate of return for Project 2
irr_project2 = np.irr(cf_project2)
print("Project 2 IRR: " + str(round(100*irr_project2, 2)) + "%")

# Project 1 IRR: 28.92%
# Project 2 IRR: 28.78%

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>####
<strong>Make a Decision Based on IRR</strong></p>

<p>If you were making the decision solely based on internal rate of return, which project would you be more interested in (assuming the IRR is greater than your required rate of return)?</p>

<p>Assume your required rate of return is 10% for this example.</p>

<p>Project 1! Because higher internal rates of return are preferable!</p>

<strong>Debt and Equity Financing</strong></p>

<p>In the previous chapter, you were able to assume that your discount rate for the NPV calculation was solely based on a measure such as inflation.</p>

<p>However, in this chapter, you are the CEO of a new company that has outstanding debt and financing costs, which you will have to adjust for.</p>

<p>You will use the WACC as your discount rate in upcoming exercises.</p>

<p>For this exercise, assume you take out a $1,000,000 loan to finance the project, which will be your company’s only outstanding debt. This loan will represent 50% of your company’s total financing of $2,000,000. The remaining funding comes from the market value of equity.</p>

<strong>Calculating WACC</strong></p>

<p>In addition to determining the proportion of both equity and debt financing, you will need to estimate the cost of financing via both debt and equity in order to estimate your WACC.</p>

<p>The
 <strong>cost of debt</strong>
 financing can be estimated as the amount you will have to pay on a new loan. This can be estimated by looking at the interest rates of loans of similar sizes to similar companies, or could be based on previous loans your company may already have been issued.</p>

<p>The
 <strong>cost of equity</strong>
 financing can be estimated as the return on equity of similar companies. Calculating the return on equity is a simple accounting exercise, but all you need to know is that essentially, investors will require a rate of return that is close to what could be earned by a similar investment.</p>

<strong>Comparing Project NPV with IRR</strong></p>

<p>Companies use their WACC as the discount rate when calculating the net present value of potential projects.</p>

<p>In the same way that you discounted values by inflation in the previous chapter to account for costs over time, companies adjust the cash flows of potential projects by their cost of financing (the WACC) to account for their investor’s required rate of return based on market conditions.</p>

<p>Now that you calculated the WACC, you can determine the net present value (NPV) of each project’s cash flows. The cash flows for projects 1 and 2 are available as
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cf_project1</code>
 and
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cf_project2</code>
 .</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Set your weighted average cost of capital equal to 12.9%
wacc = 0.129

# Calculate the net present value for Project 1
npv_project1 = np.npv(rate=wacc, values=cf_project1)
print("Project 1 NPV: " + str(round(npv_project1, 2)))

# Calculate the net present value for Project 2
npv_project2 = np.npv(rate=wacc, values=cf_project2)

# Project 1 NPV: 856073.18
# Project 2 NPV: 904741.35

<p>If you were making the decision solely based on net present value, which project would you be more interested in?</p>

<p>Project 2! Higher net present value is a good thing.</p>

<strong>Two Project With Different Lifespans</strong></p>

<p>The board of the company has decided to go a different direction, involving slightly shorter term projects and lower initial investments.</p>

<p>Your project managers have come up with two new ideas, and projected the cash flows for each of the proposals.</p>

<p>Project 1 has a lifespan of 8 years, but Project 2 only has a lifespan of 7 years. Project 1 requires an initial investment of $700,000, but Project 2 only requires $400,000.</p>

<p>The cash flow projections for both projects are as follows:</p>

<p>|

<p>####
<strong>Calculating IRR and NPV With Different Project Lifespans</strong></p>

<p>Now that you calculated the WACC, you can calculate and compare the IRRs and NPVs of each project.</p>

<p>While the IRR remains relatively comparable across projects, the NPV, on the other hand, will be much more difficult to compare given the additional year required for project 1.</p>

<p>Luckily, in the next exercise, we will introduce another method to compare the NPVs of the projects, but we will first need to compute the NPVs as before.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate the IRR for Project 1
irr_project1 = np.irr(cf_project1)
print("Project 1 IRR: " + str(round(100*irr_project1, 2)) + "%")

# Calculate the IRR for Project 2
irr_project2 = np.irr(cf_project2)
print("Project 2 IRR: " + str(round(100*irr_project2, 2)) + "%")

# Set the wacc equal to 12.9%
wacc = 0.129

# Calculate the NPV for Project 1
npv_project1 = np.npv(rate=wacc, values=cf_project1)
print("Project 1 NPV: " + str(round(npv_project1, 2)))

# Calculate the NPV for Project 2
npv_project2 = np.npv(rate=wacc, values=cf_project2)
print("Project 2 NPV: " + str(round(npv_project2, 2)))

# Project 1 IRR: 22.94%
# Project 2 IRR: 26.89%
# Project 1 NPV: 302744.98
# Project 2 NPV: 231228.39

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The NPVs really aren’t comparable.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Using the Equivalent Annual Annuity Approach</strong></p>

<p>Since the net present values of each project are not directly comparable given the different lifespans of each project, you will have to consider a different approach.</p>

<p>The
 <strong>equivalent annual annuity</strong>
 (EAA) approach allows us to compare two projects by essentially assuming that each project is an investment generating a flat interest rate each year (an annuity), and calculating the annual payment you would receive from each project, discounted to present value.</p>

<p>You can compute the EAA of each project using the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pmt(rate, nper, pv, fv)</code>
 function in
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code>
 .</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate the EAA for Project 1
eaa_project1 = np.pmt(rate=wacc, nper=8, pv=-npv_project1, fv=0)
print("Project 1 EAA: " + str(round(eaa_project1, 2)))

# Calculate the EAA for Project 2
eaa_project2 = np.pmt(rate=wacc, nper=7, pv=-npv_project2, fv=0)
print("Project 2 EAA: " + str(round(eaa_project2, 2)))

# Project 1 EAA: 62872.2
# Project 2 EAA: 52120.61

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is one of a few ways to deal with this problem.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Making a Data-Driven Decision on Projects of Different Lifespans</strong></p>

<p>If you were making the decision solely based on the equivalent annual annuity analysis, which project would you be more interested in?</p>

<p>Project 1!</p>

<p>Higher EAA means higher annual returns.</p>

<strong>Taking Out a Mortgage Loan</strong></p>

<p>You’re expecting a child soon, and its time to start looking for a home.</p>

<p>You’re currently living out of an apartment in New York City, but your blossoming career as a Data Scientist has allowed you to save up a sizable sum and purchase a home in neighboring Hoboken, New Jersey.</p>

<p>You have decided to purchase a beautiful brownstone home in the $800,000 range. While you do have a considerable amount of cash on hand, you don’t have enough to purchase the entire home outright, which means you will have to take the remaining balance out as a
 <strong>mortgage loan</strong>
 . From the sound of it, you’ll have to put about 20% down up-front to a mortgage loan of that size.</p>

<p>This up-front payment is known as a
 <strong>down payment</strong>
 .</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Set the value of the home you are looking to buy
home_value = 800000

# What percentage are you paying up-front?
down_payment_percent = 0.2

# Calculate the dollar value of the down payment
down_payment = home_value * down_payment_percent
print("Initial Down Payment: " + str(down_payment))

# Calculate the value of the mortgage loan required after the down payment
mortgage_loan = home_value - down_payment

# Initial Down Payment: 160000.0
# Mortgage Loan: 640000.0

<p>####
<strong>Calculating the Monthly Mortgage Payment</strong></p>

<p>In order to make sure you can afford the home, you will have to calculate the monthly mortgage payment you will have to make on a loan that size.</p>

<p>Now, since you will be paying a monthly mortgage, you will have to convert each of the parameters into their monthly equivalents. Be careful when adjusting the interest rate, which is compounding!</p>

<p>In order to calculate the monthly mortgage payment, you will use the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code>
 function
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pmt(rate, nper, pv)</code>
 where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rate</code>
 = The periodic (monthly) interest rate</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nper</code>
 = The number of payment periods (months) in the lifespan of the mortgage loan</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pv</code>
 = The total value of the mortgage loan</li>
</ul>

<p>You have been given a 30-year mortgage loan quote for your desired amount at 3.75%. The value of the mortgage loan is available as
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mortgage_loan</code>
 .</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Derive the equivalent monthly mortgage rate from the annual rate
mortgage_rate_periodic = (1 + mortgage_rate) ** (1/12) - 1

# How many monthly payment periods will there be over 30 years?
mortgage_payment_periods = 30 * 12

# Calculate the monthly mortgage payment (multiply by -1 to keep it positive)
periodic_mortgage_payment = -1*np.pmt(mortgage_rate_periodic, mortgage_payment_periods, mortgage_loan)
print("Monthly Mortgage Payment: " + str(round(periodic_mortgage_payment, 2)))

# Monthly Mortgage Payment: 2941.13

<strong>Calculating Interest and Principal Payments</strong></p>

<p>Due to the size of the mortgage loan, you begin the mortgage in the initial period by paying mostly interest and retaining very little
 <strong>principal</strong>
 , or
 <strong>equity</strong>
 that goes towards the ownership of your home.</p>

<p>This means that if you were to stop paying your mortgage and sell your home after only a few years, the bank would actually own most of the home because what you paid was mostly interest, and very little principal.</p>

<strong>Simulating Periodic Payments (I)</strong></p>

<p>You have all the tools you’ll need to simulate the mortgage payments over time.</p>

<p>Every time a mortgage payment is made, the following payment will have a slightly lower percentage, which is used to pay off interest. This means that more of the remainder will go towards the portion of the home that you own instead of the bank. This is important to determine how much you will gain from selling the home before paying off your mortgage, or to determine when your mortgage is underwater. But more on that later.</p>

<p>You will now write a simple program to calculate the interest and mortgage portions of each payment over time.</p>

<strong>Monthly Expenses and Savings</strong></p>

<p>In order to make it in New York City, you have decided to split a two-bedroom apartment with a friend. You will have to budget for rent, food and entertainment, but it’s also a good idea to allocate an amount for unforeseen expenses each month. This unforeseen expenses budget could be used for anything ranging from new clothes or electronics to doctor appointments.</p>

<p>Set up your monthly budget as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rent: $1200 / month (Includes utilities)</li>
  <li>Food: $30 / day (On average. Includes groceries and eating out.)</li>
  <li>Entertainment: $200 / month (Movies, drinks, museums, parties…)</li>
  <li>Unforeseen Expenses: 250 / month (Stay safe, and don’t drop your phone!)</li>
</ul>

<p>For this application, assume an average of 30 days per month. Whatever is left after your paying your monthly expenses will go into your savings account each month.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Forecast Salary Growth and Cost of Living</strong></p>

<p>Due to both inflation and increased productivity from experience, you can expect your salary to grow at different rates depending on your job. Now, since you are working in a growing and in-demand career field as a Data Scientist, you can assume a steady growth in your annual salary every year based on performance.</p>

<p>You can assume an annual salary growth rate of 5%, which means if you start at $85,000 per year, you can expect to earn over $176,000 per year after 15 years. After taxes, assuming your tax rate hasn’t changed, that works out to roughly $125,000 per year, which is not unreasonable for a Data Scientist. In fact, you might even make it to that level in a few years! But just to be safe, you should be conservative with your projections.</p>

<p>For this application, assume all inflation and salary growth happens in smaller increments on a monthly basis instead of just one large increase at the end of each year.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Create monthly forecasts up to 15 years from now
forecast_months = 12*15

# Set your annual salary growth rate
annual_salary_growth = 0.05

# Calculate your equivalent monthly salary growth rate
monthly_salary_growth = (1 + annual_salary_growth) ** (1/12) - 1

# Forecast the cumulative growth of your salary
cumulative_salary_growth_forecast = np.cumprod(np.repeat(1 + monthly_salary_growth, forecast_months))

# Calculate the actual salary forecast
salary_forecast = monthly_takehome_salary * cumulative_salary_growth_forecast

# Plot the forecasted salary
plt.plot(salary_forecast, color='blue')
plt.show()

<p>That’s becomes a mighty fine salary very quickly.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Forecast Growing Expenses Due to Inflation</strong></p>

<p>You will also assume your monthly expenses will rise by an average of 2.5% per year due to
 <strong>inflation</strong>
 . This will lead to higher
 <strong>cost of living</strong>
 over time, paying for the same expenses each year but at a higher price. Luckily, your salary is growing faster than inflation, which means you should have more money going into savings each month.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Set the annual inflation rate
annual_inflation = 0.025

# Calculate the equivalent monthly inflation rate

# Forecast cumulative inflation over time
cumulative_inflation_forecast = np.cumprod(np.repeat(1 + monthly_inflation, forecast_months))

# Calculate your forecasted expenses

<p>Not bad! But there’s a better way to accumulate wealth over time.</p>

<p>####
<strong>So You Want to Be a Millionaire?</strong></p>

<p>Your projections show that you can accumulate over $700,000 in just 15 years by following a strict budget and growing your salary steadily over time.</p>

<p>But you want to be a millionaire in 15 years, retire young, sip margaritas and travel for the rest of your life. In order to do that, you’re going to need to invest.</p>

<p>Remember the
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pmt()</code>
 function from
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numpy</code>
 ? You can use this function to calculate how much you need to save each month in order to accumulate your desired wealth over time.</p>

<p>You still have a lot to learn about the stock market, but your financial advisor told you that you can earn anywhere from 5-10% per year on your capital on average by investing in a low cost index fund.</p>

<p>You know that the stock market doesn’t always go up, but you will assume a modest 7% return per year, which has been the average annual return in the US stock market from 1950-2009.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Set the annual investment return to 7%
investment_rate_annual = 0.07

# Calculate the monthly investment return
investment_rate_monthly = (1 + investment_rate_annual) ** (1/12) - 1

# Calculate your required monthly investment to amass $1M
required_investment_monthly = np.pmt(rate=investment_rate_monthly, nper=forecast_months, pv=0, fv=-1000000)
print("You will have to invest $" + str(round(required_investment_monthly, 2)) + " per month to amass $1M over 15 years")

# You will have to invest $3214.35 per month to amass $1M over 15 years

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>$3000 per month?! Let’s start slow, and build it up over time.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Investing a Percentage of Your Income (I)</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, you really can’t afford to save $3,000 per month in order to amass $1,000,000 after only 15 years.</p>

<p>But what you can do is start slowly, investing a small percentage of your take-home income each month, which should grow over time as your income grows as well.</p>

<p>In this exercise, you will lay the foundations to simulate this investing process over time.</p>

<p>The
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">salary_forecast</code>
 and
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expenses_forecast</code>
 variables are available from the previous exercise.</p>

<p>The
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cash_flow_forecast</code>
 is also available, and is an array of your forecasted salary minus your forecasted expenses. The
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">monthly_investment_percentage</code>
 variable is already set to 0.30.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Calculate your monthly deposit into your investment account
investment_deposit_forecast = cash_flow_forecast * monthly_investment_percentage

# The rest goes into your savings account
savings_forecast_new = cash_flow_forecast * (1 - monthly_investment_percentage)

# Calculate your cumulative savings over time
cumulative_savings_new = np.cumsum(savings_forecast_new)

# Plot your forecasted monthly savings vs investments
plt.plot(investment_deposit_forecast, color='red')
plt.plot(savings_forecast_new, color='blue')
plt.legend(handles=[investments_plot, savings_plot], loc=2)
plt.show()

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>####
<strong>Investing a Percentage of Your Income (II)</strong></p>

<p>To finish up your investment simulation, you will need to loop through each time period, calculate the growth of any investments you have already made, add your new monthly deposit, and calculate your net worth at each point in time.</p>

<p>Cumulative savings (
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cumulative_savings_new</code>
 ) from the previous exercise is available, and
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">investment_portfolio</code>
 and
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net_worth</code>
 are pre-allocated empty numpy arrays of length equal to
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forecast_months</code>
 .</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Loop through each forecast period
for i in range(forecast_months):

    # Find the previous investment deposit amount
    if i == 0:
        previous_investment = 0
    else:
        previous_investment = investment_portfolio[i-1]

    # Calculate the value of your previous investments, which have grown
    previous_investment_growth = previous_investment*(1 + investment_rate_monthly)

    # Add your new deposit to your investment portfolio
    investment_portfolio[i] =  previous_investment_growth + investment_deposit_forecast[i]

    # Calculate your net worth at each point in time
    net_worth[i] = np.cumsum(cumulative_savings_new[i] + investment_portfolio[i])

# Plot your forecasted cumulative savings vs investments and net worth
plot_investments(investment_portfolio, cumulative_savings_new, net_worth)

<p>####
<strong>Investing Over Time</strong></p>

<p>If you would like to accumulate $1,000,000 over 15 years, at 7% per year, you will have to invest $3214.35 per month:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
np.pmt(rate=((1+0.07)**(1/12) - 1),
       nper=15*12, pv=0, fv=1000000)
# -3214.351338524575

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But what if you were willing to wait an extra 15 years, for a total of 30 years? How much will you need to invest each month?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
np.pmt(rate=((1+0.07)**(1/12) - 1),
       nper=30*12, pv=0, fv=1000000)

# -855.1009225937204

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Compounded returns mean you only need to save $855.10 per month.</p>

<p>####
<strong>Inflation-Adjusted Net Worth</strong></p>

<p>By saving 30% per year, your simulation shows that you can accumulate $896,962.66. Not quite a millionaire, but not bad at all!</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume you were able to save $900,000 by following your budget.</p>

<p>But what if you retire 15 years from now? What is $900,000 going to be truly worth 15 years from now?</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
import numpy as np

# Set your future net worth
future_net_worth = 900000

# Set the annual inflation rate to 2.5%
annual_inflation = 0.025

# Calculate the present value of your terminal wealth over 15 years
inflation_adjusted_net_worth = np.pv(rate=annual_inflation, nper=15, pmt=0, fv=-1*future_net_worth)
print("Your inflation-adjusted net worth: $" + str(round(inflation_adjusted_net_worth, 2)))

# Your inflation-adjusted net worth: $621419.0

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The End.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and hope you’ve learned a lot.</p>
