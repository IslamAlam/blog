# Advanced Deep Learning with Keras

## 1. The Keras Functional API

In this chapter, you'll become familiar with the basics of the Keras functional API. You'll build a simple functional network using functional building blocks, fit it to data, and make predictions.

## 2. Two Input Networks Using Categorical Embeddings, Shared Layers, and Merge Layers

In this chapter, you will build two-input networks that use categorical embeddings to represent high-cardinality data, shared layers to specify re-usable building blocks, and merge layers to join multiple inputs to a single output. By the end of this chapter, you will have the foundational building blocks for designing neural networks with complex data flows.

## 3. Multiple Inputs: 3 Inputs (and Beyond!)

In this chapter, you will extend your 2-input model to 3 inputs, and learn how to use Keras' summary and plot functions to understand the parameters and topology of your neural networks. By the end of the chapter, you will understand how to extend a 2-input model to 3 inputs and beyond.
